# Model 1 — High-Density Judgment Framework

> **Purpose**
>
> This repository is not a self-help guide, coaching framework, or behavioral psychology model.  
> It documents a stop-loss–oriented way of thinking: how to recognize when a situation continues to consume time, energy, or integrity without producing viable outcomes — and how to exit before irreversible damage occurs.
>
> No attempt is made to persuade, motivate, or optimize behavior.  
> The material assumes the reader already feels something is structurally wrong.
>
> This work is descriptive, not prescriptive.  
> Use is voluntary. Responsibility remains with the reader.

## 中文说明（极短镜像｜硬定义，不扩写）

这不是情绪安慰、自助、劝导或心理建议。它只记录一种**止损式判断结构**：当一个系统持续消耗时间/精力/尊严，却不再产出可行结果时，如何在不可逆损伤发生前退出。

本仓库不提供“你该怎么做”，不负责给希望，也不替任何人承担后果。使用是自愿的；现实责任永远在读者本人。

中文仅作为入口镜像用于对齐边界与代价；**英文为准（English as canonical）**。任何将判断抽离语境、单独引用的使用方式，均视为误用。

## What this is
Model 1 is a high-density judgment framework designed for irreversible decisions,
structural risk assessment, and no-win scenario detection.
It prioritizes clarity, responsibility, and long-term consequence over comfort.

## Who this is for
- Individuals making decisions with real cost and accountability
- Professionals operating under uncertainty, pressure, and incomplete data
- Users who prefer structure over reassurance

## Who should NOT read this
- Those seeking emotional validation or motivational content
- Users who outsource responsibility to tools or authority
- Anyone uncomfortable with cold conclusions

## Cost of using this model
- Reduced emotional comfort
- Loss of plausible deniability
- Increased personal responsibility

## Status
Frozen. Experimental.  
This framework is intentionally minimal and incomplete.  
Further expansion is deferred.
