# Model 1 — High-Density Judgment Framework

## What this is
Model 1 is a high-density judgment framework designed for irreversible decisions,
structural risk assessment, and no-win scenario detection.
It prioritizes clarity, responsibility, and long-term consequence over comfort.

## Who this is for
- Individuals making decisions with real cost and accountability
- Professionals operating under uncertainty, pressure, and incomplete data
- Users who prefer structure over reassurance

## Who should NOT read this
- Those seeking emotional validation or motivational content
- Users who outsource responsibility to tools or authority
- Anyone uncomfortable with cold conclusions

## Cost of using this model
- Reduced emotional comfort
- Loss of plausible deniability
- Increased personal responsibility

## Status
Frozen. Experimental.
This framework is intentionally minimal and incomplete.
Further expansion is deferred.
