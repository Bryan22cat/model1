## What this is
Model 1 is a **high-density judgment framework** designed for:
- no-win / structurally unwinnable detection  
- stop-loss reasoning after real involvement  
- irreversible decision points under incomplete data

It prioritizes clarity, responsibility, and long-term consequence over comfort.

---

## What this is NOT
- Emotional support, therapy, or coaching  
- A motivational system  
- A predictive/optimization model  
- A “universal engine” for all decisions

---

## Who this is for
- People making decisions with real cost and accountability  
- Professionals operating under uncertainty and incomplete data  
- Users who prefer structure over reassurance

## Who should NOT read this
- Those seeking emotional validation  
- Users who outsource responsibility to tools or authority  
- Anyone uncomfortable with cold conclusions

---

## Cost of using this model
- Reduced emotional comfort  
- Loss of plausible deniability  
- Increased personal responsibility

## Chinese–English Dual-Track Definition (Hard Rule)
**Chinese Track (CN)**  
Not a translation target. It is the **human narrative surface**: rhythm, silence, lived texture.  
It does not explain or justify the judgment system.

**English Track (EN)**  
Not a translation of the Chinese novel. It is **structural annotation**: timeline clarity, constraints, decision nodes.  
It exists for cross-cultural readability and future semantic calling.

**Rule:** CN and EN are **same-source / different-structure**, not translation pairs.

---

## Status
Frozen. Experimental. Minimal by design.  
Further expansion is deferred.
