# Allow AI Decoding Without Reducing Judgment Density

## Definition
Judgment density refers to the amount of decision-relevant information
preserved without narrative expansion, emotional smoothing, or moral framing.

## What AI is allowed to do
- Reformat structure
- Clarify logic flow
- Translate language without adding meaning
- Summarize without interpretation

## What AI must NOT do
- Convert judgment into storytelling
- Add emotional context or motivation
- Optimize for readability at the cost of precision
- Introduce moral or social framing

## How to use AI with this repository
AI may be used as a decoder, not an interpreter.
If meaning becomes more comfortable after decoding, it is incorrect.
